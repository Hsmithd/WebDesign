    <h2>My Favorite Pokemon: <b>Suicune</b></h2>

    <h3>Why I Love Suicune</h3>

    <p>Suicune is a Legendary Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation II, celebrated for its elegant, flowing mane and crystalline, wolf-like visage. It is said to embody the north wind and has the ability to purify polluted water, often appearing near clean streams and lakes. In the series’ lore, Suicune is one of the three Legendary beasts—alongside Entei and Raikou—reborn from the Legendary Pokémon Raikou when a Pokémon Tower burned; Suicune’s presence is associated with calm, restorative power and natural purity. Its design, with a regal blue body, ribbon-like tails, and the distinctive, gem-like crest on its forehead, evokes both grace and mystique, making it a favorite among fans who appreciate its serene, noble aesthetic.</p>

    <p>In the games, Suicune typically serves as a rare, roaming or stationarily-guarded encounter that challenges players to track and battle it, often requiring strategy and persistence to catch. Its strong special defense and access to powerful Water-type moves like Hydro Pump and the signature move Sheer Cold in some entries make it a formidable asset on a team, especially when used to control the battlefield and support with moves like Calm Mind or Rest. Beyond competitive play, Suicune’s role in storylines—most notably as a central figure in Pokémon Crystal and Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia—reinforces its status as a guardian of water and a narrative symbol of healing and balance within the Pokémon world.</p>
